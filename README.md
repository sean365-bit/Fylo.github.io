### What I learned

In this project I learned how to Compile SCSS to CSS, Basically to Compile the SCSS file into a regular CSS file, We need to Navigate to our project directory using the terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```SCSS

node-sass styles.scss styles.css

```

I as well learned the importance of Media Queries and how they enable us to create styles for specific devices or conditions, making our website adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.

```css
@media media-type and (media-feature) {
  /* CSS rules */
}
```
